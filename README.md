# PomodoroApp
This is my attempt at creating a Pomodoro style app for helping me focus on work.

### Problem

I have issues focusing on my work. I was once suggested to use the Pomodoro technique to help me focus on my work without getting distracted overtime. The Pomodor technique is to break up work time with occasional breaks to avoid work fatigue. I found some apps that provided such a service, but found the requirement to pay or subscribe to access all features was annoying to me. So, I now plan on creating my own version of a Pomodor web application that I can modify to my needs.

### Objectives

1. Create a web application with the fundamental aspects of a Pomodoro technique, along with modifiable work and break times.
2. Add HTML for basic functionality, and later CSS for clearer user experience.
3. Add Task functionality to keep track of how many Pomodoro cycles I go through to accomplish a Task. Could alternatively create a timeline system that showcases what Tasks were completed during a Pomodoro cycle.
